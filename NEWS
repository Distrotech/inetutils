Version 1.8:

* ftp

New options --active and --passive to enable/disable active transfer
mode.  The short option for --prompt has been removed, and is instead
now used to enable passive transfer mode.

* ifconfig

New commands (up and down) to bring up/down an interface using
ifconfig.

The short option for --address, -a, has been renamed to -A.  And --all
now uses -a instead.

New commands (multicast, allmulti) to set multicast flags.

New option -s displays a short list of interfaces (similar to netstat
-i).

The --format option can be used to read format from a file.  To do so,
prefix the file name with a '@' sign, e.g.:

          ifconfig --format=@FILE

The contents of this file is read literally, except that the lines
beginning with a `#' sign are ignored (and can thus be used to
introduce comments).

To obtain a list of the available built-in output formats, use

         ifconfig --format=help

When used with the --verbose option, --format=help also displays
format definitions.

* Man pages for the daemons are now in section 8 instead of 1.

* There is now a man page for ping6 too.

December 16, 2009
Version 1.7:

* ping

New option --timeout=N, stop sending packets after N seconds.

* New logger implementation

The `logger' utility has been rewritten from scratch.  The new
implementation offers many new facilities.  In particular, it
is able to send messages to system loggers on remote machines, and
to supply the PID number to include in messages, instead of the
PID of the `logger' process.

* Restore the traditional behavior of ping without -c option.

* The manual is now licensed under the GNU FDL version 1.3 or later.

* rexec

New program.

* tftp

Command line parsing now uses argp.

* Man pages for all tools are generated using help2man.


December 27, 2008
Version 1.6:

* Various bugs fixes and clean ups.

* hostname, traceroute

New programs.

* ping and ping6 now exit after four packets instead of pinging forever.

The previous behaviour can be enabled by passing `--count 0' to ping
(or ping6).

* telnet now delays initialization of Shishi until Kerberos is needed

* inetd

The configuration file syntax has been extended to allow for supplying
local addresses `inetd' should use when listening for a given service.
The addresses may be specified on a per-server basis as well as
globally (affecting several services). 

It is possible to limit the number of service instances for `nowait'
services. 

October 21, 2006
Version 1.5:

* Various bugs fixes and clean ups.

* inetd

** New option --environment enables passing client/server data via
environment variables.

** New option --resolve enables resolving IP addresses before passing
them via environment.

** Allows numeric port names as service names

** inetd now creates a PID file

* rcp now supports the -V option

* rshd/rexecd now switches to the users home directory after
  authentication.

* rlogin now supports XON/XOFF without needing -8.

* syslogd now can actually disable forwarding.

* talk allows the use of 8-bit ASCII.

* telnet not subject to certain DNS spoofing techniques that could
  possibly foil Kerberos authentication.

December 22, 2002
Version 1.4.2:

* Fix endianess problem in ftpd.

* Various portability updates.

* Security fix for rexecd/rshd.

* Fix processing accumulated messages in syslogd

September 02, 2002
Version 1.4.1:

* Fixes a build problem on Solaris

* rsh now honours -V as well as --version

* Fixed a security problem with rshd where new files were being
  created as uid 0.

* Fixed improper ping initialization.

* The syntax of syslog.conf file has been extended. The new
  wildcard facility specification, **, catches all messages with
  a facility not specified explicitely in the configuration file. 

July 31, 2002
Version 1.4.0:

* It is now possible to specify whether to compile individual
  utilities using arguments to configure.

* The GNU networking utilities manual has been started.

* If you have the GNU readline library installed, it will now be used
  by the ftp client.

* There is now a whois client.

* Several security fixes and other bug fixes have been applied.

* The inetd server can read configuration file snippets from
  /etc/inetd.d/.

* The talkd and telnetd servers have been essentially rewritten.

* The ping program was added.

* The syslogd server supports several new features in the
  configuration file, like omitting file sync, piping messages into
  programs etc.  It also supports several new options on the command
  line.

* Inetutils should generally compile on most platforms now.

March, 13, 1998
Version 1.3.2:

 This release attempts to get the encryption/authentication options to
 compile correctly; they appear to work on systems with the appropriate
 libraries, but have not been well tested.

September, 11, 1997
Version 1.3.1:

 This release fixes various small problems.

 Telnet now won't force the stripping of 8-bit characters when not in binary
 mode (it will leave the terminal in whatever state it was originally).

February, 25, 1997
Version 1.3:

 More portable again than 1.2.  It is still very BSD-specific, but now
 works on many popular systems, such as linux and sunos/solaris.
 
 The talk program finally seems to work.

 ftp now supports a --prompt option to force it to print a prompt, even
 when not on a tty (this makes it possible to use ange-ftp with pipes).

 rsh now supports long options.

 Many security fixes have been made, so this release should be more secure
 than previous ones.

August, 21, 1996
Version 1.2:

 An attempt to be somewhat more portable, and reorganize the code to make
 porting a bit easier; it is still very BSD-specific.

 A major bug in ftpd bug that prevents most logins from succeeding is
 fixed, as well as other, more minor, bugs.

Version 1.1:

 A minor release intended only for the GNU hurd.

 This release adds checking for crypt at both compile and runtime (on
 systems where weak refs are supported).
