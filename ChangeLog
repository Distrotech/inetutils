2002-04-05  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@Mirddin.farlep.net>

2002-02-12  Jeff Bailey  <jbailey@outpost.dnsalias.org>

	* TODO: Remove ping

	* THANKS: Update

	* README-alpha: *Wow* this file was really inaccurate.

	* NEWS: Mention talkd, and ping

	* AUTHORS: Update

2002-02-10  Jeff Bailey  <jbailey@outpost.dnsalias.org>

	* configure.in: Reworked for autoconf 2.52 and renamed to
	* configure.ac: this.

	* autogen.sh: Don't point autoheader to headers/

        * headers/acconfig.h: Move to ...
	* acconfig.h: Here

	* Makefile.am: Require Automake 1.5.  Add doc and doc/rfc to 
	build tree.  Don't tell autoheader to look in headers/

        I moved config.h to the top_builddir to overcome a bug in
	autoconf that requires the config.h to be in the same 
	directory as aclocal.m4

	This meant that I also had to add
	INCLUDES=-I$(top_builddir)/include.  The upshot is that make
	distcheck now passes, even for $(srcdir)!=$(builddir)
  
	* .cvsignore: Add files relating moving config.h to
	$(top_builddir)

2001-12-25  Alain Magloire

	* configure.in:  Add check for mkstemp ().
	Check for getpass().
	Note from Bert De Knuydt <Bert.Deknuydt@esat.kuleuven.ac.be>.

2001-11-21  Sergey Poznyakoff

	* configure.in: Removed poll.h, sys/poll.h from AC_CHECK_HEADERS.
	Added individual check for poll.h, since syslogd uses it
	unconditionally.

2001-11-03  Alain Magloire

	* configure.in: Added doc/rfc/Makefile.

2001-11-02  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: When checking for utmp structure fields, always
	include sys/types.h [HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H] before utmp.h (for time_t)
	to get it working on FreeBSD.  Add checks for fields pid, id and
	user.

2001-11-02  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* configure.in: Add doc/Makefile as output file.

2001-10-28  Alain Magloire

	Certain programs __MUST__ be install root to work properly. There is
	a hook in the installation to warn the user.  But maybe in the future
	we should try to install as root and failed the installation if it
	does not work?

	* ping/Makefile.am: Rules to try install setuid root.
	* rcp/Makefile.am: Rules to try install setuid root.
	* rlogin/Makefile.am: Rules to try install setuid root.
	* rsh/Makefile.am: Rules to try install setuid root.

2001-10-25  Alain Magloire

	* configure.in: Version to 1.3.2g.

2001-10-25  Sergey Poznyakoff

	* acinclude.m4: IU_INCLUDED_REGEX: Check for working regex,
	provide replacement, if necessary.
	* configure.in: Check for regex.

2001-09-06  Alain Magloire

	* configure.in: Check for strsignal().
	* libinetutils/strsignal.c: New file.

2001-08-29  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Remove `ifconfig' for now
	(see ifconfig/TODO for a list of items that need to be resolved).

2001-08-26  Alain Magloire

	Marco D'Itri whois is much more complete then the original
	one provided by Joel N. Weber II (devnull).  So it is enable.

	* configure.in: use gwhois instead whois
	* Makefile.am: SUBDIRS have gwhois instead of whois.

2001-08-25  Alain Magloire

	* configure.in: AC_ARG_ENABLE(libls ..) libls will not work
	on all platforms, make it possible to disable it.
	LIBLS, BUILD_LIBLS, WITH_LIBLS, new variable.s
	* header/acconfig.h: WITH_LIBLS new.

2001-07-14  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>

	* rlogind: See rlogind/ChangeLog.
	* ping: See ping/ChangeLog.

2001-06-20  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>
	Patches by Alain:
	* libicmp(icmp_cksum.c,icmp_echo.c,icmp_timestamp.c,libping.c):
		use <signal.h> instead of <sys/signal.h>,
		truncate pid_t before using as ping_ident.
	* libicmp/ping.h: changed type of ping_datalen to size_t.
	* libicmp/icmp_address.c: icmp was used unitialized.
	* ping(ping_address.c,ping_echo.c,ping_router.c,ping_timestamp.c):
		<signal.h> -> <sys/signal.h>

2001-06-19  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>
	* configure.in, Makefile.am: added libicmp and ping to build.
	* ping/Makefile.am: use @BUILD_PING@ instead of directly
	  assigning bin_PROGRAMS.
	* libicmp/icmp_timestamp.c: forgotten to commit yesterday :^)
	* libicmp/ping.h: changed counters in struct PING from int to longs.
	* libicmp/icmp.h,libicmp/libping.c,
	  ping/ping.c,ping/ping_address.c,ping/ping_echo.c,
	  ping/ping_impl.h,ping/ping_router.c,ping/ping_timestamp.c:
		Fixed a bunch of inconsistencies (thanks to Alain).
		Changes to make gcc -Wall less verbose.

2001-06-18  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>
	* libicmp/Makefile.am: added icmp_address.c
	* libicmp/icmp_address.c: added.
	* libicmp/icmp.h: added new protos
	* libicmp/icmp_echo.c: eliminated unused variable
	* libicmp/icmp_timestamp.c: implemented
	* libicmp/libping.c: changes too numerous to mention.
	* libicmp/ping.h: reflect changes to libping.c
	* ping/Makefile.am: added OMIT_DEPENDENCIES
	* ping/(ping.c,ping_address.c,ping_echo.c,ping_impl.h,ping_timestamp.c)
		Implemented ICMP_TIMESTAMP and ICMP_ADDRESSMASK requests.
          None of existing routers answers the latter, though.


2001-06-13  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>
	* libicmp(Makefile.am, icmp.h, icmp_cksum.c, icmp_echo.c,
	  icmp_timestamp.c,libping.c,ping.h): added to repository.
	  Currently it is more libping than libicmp, I will be adding
          required functionality latter.
	* ping/ping.c: implemented
	* ping_address.c, ping_echo.c, ping_impl.h, ping_router.c,
	  ping_timestamp.c: added to repository.
	* paths: PATH_HEQUIV needs search in <netdb.h> (for Solaris)

2001-06-05  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>

	* libinetutils/ttymsg.c (normalize_path): Define static and provide
	a prototype and it was call with the wrong number of arguments.

2001-06-05  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>

        * ftpd/ftpd.c: MAP_FAILED is not defined on some systems
          (e.g. Solaris, SunOS)
        * headers/paths.h: Added missing _PATH_LOGCONF, _PATH_LOGPID,
          _PATH_LOG
        * libls/print.c: Provided defaults for major() and minor() macros
          for systems lacking them.

2001-06-02  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@farlep.net>

	* libinetutils/ttymsg.c: Simple check for '/' in the line name is
	way too week: it doesn't work for tty names like pts/2, which are
	perfectly OK. Changed to more sophisticated one: all "./", "../"
	references in the name are resolved and the resulting name is
	compared with PATH_TTY_PFX. If it lies under it, everything's
	Ok. Otherwise we just bail out and quit.
	* talk/display.c: Added check for *text == '\a' to produce audible
	bell.
	* talk/io.c: changed \007's in initial message to beep() after
	message(). On solaris's AT386 those \007 just produce ^G on
	the screen.
	Changed read(0, buf, nb) to getch() in loop. Reason: read()
	returns raw data from console, thus pressing <enter> returns
	'\r' which gets displayed on console as ^M, because display.c
	is expecting to get '\n'. getch() returns '\n' and everything
	goes smooth.
	* talk/announce.c: syslog error message from ttymsg(). One never
	knows...
	* talkd/process.c: changed find_user(). Previous version returned
	first console the remote party was logged onto. This one returns
	the one where he currently is. This is a slightly modified version
	of berkeley's find_user() dated 1997/04/06.

2001-05-07  Jeff Bailey  <jbailey@oasis.zugzug.com>

	Remove from CVS repository - They are automatically generated.

1999-05-19 Alain Magloire
	* configure.in : check for ptsname(), this will give
	a hint to use SYSVR4 pseudo ptys handling.  particularly
	for telnetd and rlogind.
	* libinetutls/utmp_{init,logout} : new files.
	* libinetutils/openpty.c : a new version that should be
	compatible with SYSV STREAM.
	* paths : add check for PATH_UTMPX and PATH_WTMPX
	* configure.in : add check for getcwd, since we use xgetcwd.

1999-05-18 Dan Stromberg
	* headers/arpa/tftp.h : changing tu_clock to be unsigned to handle
	larger files (twice as big), without sacrificing anything.
	We need this to allow sgis to roboinst from a sun tftp server.

1999-05-16 Alain Magloire
	* config.{guess,sub} : files removed from the repository.
	We let automake -a create a newer version when releasing

	Noted by Jeff Bailey.
