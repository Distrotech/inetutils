Notes about the compatibility to various system's ifconfig program.

all systems

	We don't support any protocol families but inet (version 4).
	The systems command line interface is not completely implemented.


i386-gnu-linux (net-tools)

	Metric is reported as 1, we report it correctly as 0.
	(The metric is the number of additional hops, not the number of
	hops total -- the Linux kernel <= 2.4 returns the correct number
	0, it's just net-tools that converts this to 1).

	Uses the output format `net-tools'.  This does not report the
	statistics as recorded in /proc/net/dev.  (The format of this file
	is unsatisfying).


hpux10.20

	Uses the output format `unix'.  This might include more information
	than is included in the output of the system ifconfig.  The
	additional info is available with the system command lanscan
	on HP-UX.


sparc-sun-solaris-2.7

	Uses the output format `unix'.


alphaev56-dec-osf4.0g

	Uses the output format `osf'.
